# 📌 Career Roadmap for Parth (Java + IT Industry | Banking Domain)

## 🎯 Goal
Switch into a higher-paying development role in 1–1.5 years, strengthen core dev + system design, and prepare for long-term career in **Java backend, system design, and AI/ML awareness**.

---

## 📂 Phase 1: Immediate (0–3 Months)
> Focus on strengthening fundamentals + interview prep side-by-side.

### 🔹 Java & Backend
- Revise **Java Core**:
  - Collections, Generics, Multithreading, Streams, Lambda
  - Exception handling, Functional Interfaces
- Practice **OOP + Design Patterns**:
  - Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy
- Hands-on with **Spring Boot**:
  - REST APIs, Security (JWT, OAuth2), Exception handling
  - Integration with databases (JPA/Hibernate)

### 🔹 Database
- SQL Deep Dive:
  - Joins, Indexing, Stored Procedures
  - Transaction Isolation Levels
- PL/SQL brush-up (since you prepared earlier)

### 🔹 Practice
- Solve **LeetCode Easy → Medium (2 Q/day)**  
- Focus: Arrays, Strings, HashMap, Stack/Queue, Recursion

---

## 📂 Phase 2: Short Term (3–6 Months)
> Build project muscle + system knowledge.

### 🔹 Projects
- **Banking Mini-Project** (Spring Boot + React or Angular):
  - User Authentication + Role-based access
  - Transactions Module (Transfer, Mini Statement)
  - Audit Logging

- Deploy project to **AWS Free Tier** (EC2 + RDS + S3).

### 🔹 System Design Basics
- Learn **Low-Level Design (LLD)**:
  - Class Diagrams, SOLID Principles
- Learn **High-Level Design (HLD)**:
  - API Gateway, Load Balancer, Database Sharding
- Resources: Grokking System Design, GitHub system design repos

### 🔹 Practice
- LeetCode **Medium (3–4 Q/week)**
- Focus on **Banking-related DSA problems** (LRU Cache, Transactions, Consistency problems)

---

## 📂 Phase 3: Mid Term (6–12 Months)
> Interview readiness + high-value skills.

### 🔹 Advanced Java + Backend
- Spring Boot Advanced:
  - Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
  - Microservices, Feign Client, Resilience4j
- **Docker + Kubernetes (Basics)**:
  - Containerize a Spring Boot app
  - Deploy to Minikube / AWS EKS

### 🔹 Cloud
- AWS Associate-level skills:
  - EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, IAM
  - CI/CD basics with GitHub Actions or Jenkins

### 🔹 Interview Prep
- Daily **LeetCode Medium/Hard**
- System Design mock interviews
- Revise Banking domain concepts (core banking, transactions, batch processing)

---

## 📂 Phase 4: Long Term (12–18 Months)
> Targeting switch to Tier-1 product / fintech / high-paying service company.

### 🔹 Target Roles
- Java Backend Developer
- Full Stack Developer (if you push React skills)
- Associate in Product/Fintech Companies (Paytm, Razorpay, PhonePe, JP Morgan, Barclays)

### 🔹 Optional: AI/ML Awareness
- **Not core focus** (your strength = Java + Banking)
- Learn Python basics + ML fundamentals (just awareness, not deep dive)
- Understand where **AI intersects with banking**:
  - Fraud detection
  - Credit risk scoring
  - Chatbots

---

## 🛠️ Daily / Weekly Routine
- **Daily**:
  - 1 hour DSA (LeetCode/InterviewBit)
  - 1 hour Java/Spring Boot coding
- **Weekly**:
  - Weekend project building/deployment
  - Read 1 system design article or watch 1 video
- **Monthly**:
  - Update GitHub portfolio
  - Apply learnings in small POCs

---

## 📈 Expected Outcome
- In **6–9 months** → Strong portfolio + ready for product company interviews  
- In **12–18 months** → Can switch to 12–18 LPA range depending on company/domain  

---

## ✅ Key Notes
- **Don’t switch to AI/ML right now** — industry rewards depth in Java backend + system design much more.
- Leverage **Banking domain + Java** → strong niche.
- Portfolio + GitHub + System Design prep = **gamechanger for switch**.
