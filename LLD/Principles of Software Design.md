We can avoid design patterns keeping time constraints or any other constraints but there are 3 design patterns which cannot be avoided also design patterns were introduced for antipatterns 

### 1.  DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) : 
	Every piece of knowledge specifically business knowledge should be kept at one place and it should not repeat itself  
	This principle states that every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. In simple terms, avoid duplication of logic or code. Repeating code makes the system hard to maintain and error-prone. If a change is required, you might forget to update all occurrences
#### Importance:

- Reduces redundancy
- Easier maintenance
- Single point of change

#### When Not to Use the DRY Principle:

- **Premature Abstraction:** Don't extract common code too early.
    - At first glance, two code blocks might look similar, but they could change in different ways later.
    - Extracting them into a shared method can create unnecessary coupling between unrelated parts.
- **Performance-Critical Code:** Don't apply DRY to performance-sensitive code if it causes inefficiency.
    - Sometimes, repeating optimized low-level logic is faster than calling a generalized, reusable method.
    - Function calls, indirection, or generic wrappers might **reduce performance** or **block compiler optimizations** like inlining.
- **Sacrificing Readability:** If extracting repeated code **makes the code less readable**, prefer clarity over DRYness.
- **Legacy Codebases:** Don't refactor for DRY's sake in legacy code unless necessary and well-tested.
    - Legacy code might not have tests or complete documentation. Introducing DRY by extracting shared logic can accidentally change behavior.
    - Refactoring legacy code safely often follows the "leave it alone unless you must touch it" rule.
### 2.KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
	This principle states that simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. In simple terms, use the simplest possible solution that works. Avoid clever, convoluted code.

#### Importance
- Easier debugging
- Improved readability
- Better maintainability
- Faster development
#### When Not to Use the KISS Principle:
	Your code should always be simple so theres nothing where you will not use it

### 3. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
	This principle states that **"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."**. In simple terms, don't add functionality until it's necessary. Avoid building features that you think you might need in the future. This principle helps to keep the codebase clean and reduces unnecessary complexity.

#### Importance:
- Reduced waste
- Simplified codebase
- Faster development

#### When NOT to use YAGNI:
- **When the requirements are well-known:** If a feature is guaranteed and soon to be implemented, preparing for it now might be more efficient. For example:
    - You're writing a messaging service that currently supports only text, but your product team has committed to image support in 2 sprints.
    - Designing your data model to handle attachments now might save significant refactoring later.
- **Performance-Critical Areas:** In systems where performance is a first-class concern, avoiding YAGNI might actually help. Preemptively building and testing real-world usage patterns can catch bottlenecks early.
