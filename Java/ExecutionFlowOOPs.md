# Object Oriented Programming Principles:

#### Major pillars :
	1. Abstraction
		a. Getting to know only required information
		b. DAO layer where we are only exposing required fields not whole table 
		c. Abstract Classes and Interfaces (They define behaviour without actual implementation)
	2. Encapsulation
		a. Binding data and code together
		b. class binds data members and member functions
		c. Jmods or rtJar (Java internally stores its helper classes or libraries in jmod currently priorly in rt.jar)
	3. Modularity
		
	4. Hierarchy
#### Minor Pillars :
	1. Typing / Polymorphism 
	2. Concurrency
	3. Persistence
	
Java is an object oriented language with everything is stored or used as class or object just here the exception is primitive datatypes but for this we have wrapper classes 

OOPs has 2 basic principles :- 

	1. Class:
		a. Class is a logical entity 
		b. consists of data members and methods 
		c. methods can be static , non-static (Static can be accessed through class
		 names while for non static classes needs to be accessed by creating
		 objects )
		d. also called as user defined datatype
		
	2. Object:
		a. a physical entity 
		b. just an instance of class
		c. one class can have multiple objects
		d. in java to create a object we need new operator
